\section{Use Case Analysis}
\subsection{Client Side Involvement}
To identify all and good use cases, it's imperative to involve the users. This is usually very expensive: Around 30-50\% of development costs are allocated towards requirements and use case analysis and validation.

Use cases usually are text stories used to discover and record requirements. These use cases complement requirments analysis and provide operational requirements as a basis for system design.
